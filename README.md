# prjbranch

create a command line interface that lets me set up a project described in yaml or json, where the cli reads the file, lists my projects and then lets me sync the repos in a project where i say what branch to checkout
The project can have a name, one or mroe repos, and a short name you can clone into in case the repo has a long name
